The REST API and soon to be Gateway of okemia.

# Why Python?
While python can be seen as 'slow' or 'underpowered' 
it is actually fast enough and powerful enough to run something like this,
at insane speeds but of course something like rust or C would be faster but honestly
i'm not learning a new language to make the API a little bit faster.
